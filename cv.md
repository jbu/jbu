# History
<img align="right" style="padding-left: 20px" src="assets/owlogo.jpg"/>

## Lead Senior Engineer
### Oliver Wyman, London, UK
### Dec 2016 - now.

LShift was acquired by Oliver Wyman to form the core of their technology delivery capability. Since then I've been involved in various projects, mostly in the financial space.

## Senior Developer
### LShift, London, UK
### Nov 2012 – Dec 2016

"LShift is a hi-tech software development company. It is small but, we like to think, close to perfectly formed. Our company is home to some of the best developers in the UK - not only in our opinion, but in the opinion of a number of international blue chip companies who use our development and research skills."

LShift has been successfully delivering agile projects for blue-chip clients for more than 10 years. They are technology agnostic, preferring to use whatever best delivers business benefit.
Senior Developer is the only developer/architect role in the company, and is unique in that enormous freedom is given to own and direct all aspects of a project (from technical to client relationship), along with enormous responsibility to deliver. Given the exceptional caliber of the staff, this works well. Projects have ranged from data-mining open NHS data to building highly secure messaging platforms.
I joined LShift for the chance to work with such talent (and humour). I did learn a lot of technology, but the most important secret I learned was how to reliably deliver complex projects.
Technologies used so far: Clojure, Go, BigQuery, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, F#, Docker & Kubernetes, AWS, GCE/GKE, Hadoop, Spark, ElasticSearch, and many more.
Trained in [DSDM](http://www.dsdm.org/) agile project management.

## Research Fellow
### University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia
### May 2012 – Nov 2012

The [Computer Human Adapted Interaction](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/) lab conducts research in [ubiquitous computing](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html). "We are exploring the technical means by which people can make sense of what it means to ‘own’ and visualise their data in a digital world. We currently focus on e-learning and health." 
Within this role, I was lead architect and developer on a [Personis](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/Personis), a research system offering methods for users to intelligently manage and use their online profile and support [Lifelong User Modelling](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/LLUM). I also led and taught a group of computing science students from one of the most prestigious universities in Australia.

For example, the FM transmitter involved building consensus between marketing, UI, hardware, system and application teams to deliver the feature within the product schedule. I was also involved in graphics architectures, novel input devices, context awareness and some other smaller projects.
- Responsible for the architecture of product specific software for some product programs. Released products include [N80](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N80) and [N78](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N78). Contributions were also made to the [N79](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N79), [E72](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E72) and [E6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E6) among others.
- Software Lead for the N80. This involved work allocation, mentoring, reviews for permanent team members, etc. Also responsible for driving software maturity within the product.
